## Problem Specification

### With the introduction of a new Trench-Heating line at Turnbull & Scott Engineers, I was tasked with creating a WordPress powered tool which would allow customers to efficiently browse available variations based upon their filters. Additionally, customers could customise their selected products; add accessories; and download a PDF document detailing their choices with an estimated price. 

### Details of the technologies and skills I used to create this tool are as follows:
    ### - Coding involved a combination of HTML 5; CSS 3; JavaScript; and PHP (with use of the strict WordPress syntax).
    ### - Managing the creation of a front-end web page; interaction with the core WordPress database; and the creation of back-end UI which could update the database without the need for coding expertise.
    ### - Time management was important as I was balancing the functionality expectations of Turnbull & Scott; the production deadlines of Attacat (Turnbull & Scottâ€™s contracted Internet Marketing Service); and completing an achievable final product within a tight deadline of my contracted 10 weeks.
